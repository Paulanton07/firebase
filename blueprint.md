# Project Blueprint

## Overview

A Flutter application that allows users to send and receive voice messages and listen to radio stations.

## Features

* **Radio:** Listen to a curated list of radio stations.

## Current Plan

I will add the following features:

1. **Firebase Integration:** Integrate Firebase for authentication and to store voice messages.
