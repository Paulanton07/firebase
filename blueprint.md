*   **Voice Message Playback:** Users can play back recorded voice messages.
*   **Chat-like Interface:** Voice messages are displayed in a chat-like interface.

*   **Radio Page:** A separate page for radio functionality.
*   **Bottom Navigation:** A bottom navigation bar to switch between the voice messaging and radio pages.

## Style and Design
